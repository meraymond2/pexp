# pexp

A Typescript implementation of [A Pretty Expressive Printer](https://sorawee.github.io/pretty-expressive-oopsla23-artifact/full-paper.pdf). 

Note that for this version, I have made a conscious decision to follow the functions described in the paper as closely as possible. It is not intended as production-ready software in this form, and it does not include the additional optimisations and constructions described in the appendices.
